## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸš€ MVP Development Experience

As a frontend developer, Iâ€™ve built MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) for digital solutions in the **healthcare**, **construction**, and **finance** sectors. I focus on delivering functional and scalable products in early development stages, helping teams validate ideas quickly and iterate with confidence.

I work with technologies like **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, ensuring both solid architecture and a seamless user experience from the start.
