# Hi there 👋

I build web products with a primary focus on Frontend Engineering, turning requirements into clear, accessible, and production-ready interfaces. I’ve delivered MVPs and complete modules, leading frontend architecture: modular design, reusable components, state management, routing, forms, quality (testing), and documentation to scale with minimal friction.

I have experience integrating the frontend with APIs and deployment workflows, which allows me to contribute to end-to-end product delivery while remaining frontend-focused.
